Long term:
    MVP:
        scan with AI
        not an extension
        text doc
        ollama for local AI

    Final goal:
        chrome/opera GX extension
        AI to scan pages for text
        bias detector and high lighter
        yellow to red
        settings for tolerance
        hover over highlight to say why it was flagged
        suggest edits 
        scan on key press + page load
        setting for page load default off

    Problems:
        AI API for free
        the fact that it is an extension
        10s load time or less
        make sure it works at all
